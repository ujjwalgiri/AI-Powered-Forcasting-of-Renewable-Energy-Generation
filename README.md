# AI-Powered-Forcasting-of-Renewable-Energy-Generation

This project explores how to predict renewable energy output using machine learning and deep learning models. It uses weather data from multiple sources and compares different models to see which ones work best.

The project tested the following models:

CNN + LSTM
Uses convolution and LSTM layers to predict solar power.
Based on: Forecasting Solar Power Using LSTM and CNNs

WD + LSTM
Designed for wind power forecasting using a special LSTM setup.
Based on: A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Wind Power Forecasting

DRNN (Deep Recurrent Neural Network)
Predicts solar energy using deep learning.
Based on: Deep Learning Models for Solar Energy Prediction

Gaussian Mixture Density Network (GMDN)
Estimates energy output with uncertainty.
Based on: A Review of Deep Learning for Energy Forecasting

SVM with RBF Kernel
Uses support vector machines to predict solar generation.
Based on: Predicting Solar Generation with ML

Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
Uses both observed and forecast weather data for predictions.
Based on: A Two-Step ML Approach for Solar Prediction

SVR + Decision Tree Regressor Ensemble
Combines two models to predict wind power.
Based on: ML Ensembles for Wind Power Prediction

Stacking
Combines the best models into one for better accuracy.
Based on: Heuristic Approach using LazyPredict
